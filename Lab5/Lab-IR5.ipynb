    "When we think about selecting a video that our user will like, let's first consider what data we have available? First of all, we have information in the database about how our user rated the movies he once watched. It's worth noting here that this is absolutely not all of the movies in our database given, and most often it's a heavily limited subset of a huge set of movies. So we can find out which movies our user liked and which ones he didn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is this all the data available? Well, no! We also have information about the preferences of other users! So we can find in the data a sample of users who have similar movie taste to our user. Note that virtually every such other user has watched some movies that our user has never watched before! The idea behind collaborative filtering is very simple: if another user with similar tastes rated a movie highly, our user will probably rate it highly too! Let's recommend movies that users with similar tastes have rated highly!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formalize some ideas:\n",
    " - how to count the similarity between users' tastes? \n",
    " \n",
    " Just calculate the correlation between their movie ratings. Users with a strongly positive correlation have similar tastes, and those with a strongly negative correlation have opposite tastes;) \n",
    " \n",
    " - Having found similar users, how to count the predicted rating of the video by our user?\n",
    " \n",
    " We count the weighted average of ratings of users with similar tastes where the weight is the measure of similarity (correlation). The closer a user's tastes are to us, the more weight his rating has for us. (slide 27, http://www.mmds.org/mmds/v2.1/ch09-recsys1.pdf)\n"
